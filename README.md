A low effort CLI util that helps in adding emotes to the WoW Twitch Emotes addon. Only supported files are .avif and .webp from 7tv.

Dependencies: 
1. ffmpeg
2. imagemagick
3. webpinfo/webpmux
4. 
Usage:
1. Put all the emotes and the executable file in the same folder. (Optimally the folder should only contain these.)
2. Run the executable with: java -jar BuhEmoteAdder.jar

Output: It will convert the emotes to the correct format and create a text file with the contents you need to copy.

Other: If you wish to run the program again, make sure to delete/move the output files.
